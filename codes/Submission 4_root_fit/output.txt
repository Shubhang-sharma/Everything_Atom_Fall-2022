 Question-4------------------------ 
The least square polynomial fit parameters are: 
 a0 = 0.506 a1 = 5.709 a2 = -13.555 a3 = 9.25
 
 Additional Comments : It is observed that the Laguerre Method was giving only solutions upto the sign of the initial guess, 
 thus two different guesses one positive and another negative had to be used to generate the entire solution.
